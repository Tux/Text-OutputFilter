       OutputFilter - Enable post processing of output without fork

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
        use Text::OutputFilter;

        my $bucket = "";
        tie *STDOUT, "Text::OutputFilter";
        tie *HANDLE, "Text::OutputFilter", 4;
        tie *HANDLE, "Text::OutputFilter", 4,  *STDOUT;
        tie *STDOUT, "Text::OutputFilter", 4, \$bucket;
        tie *OUTPUT, "Text::OutputFilter", 4,  *STDOUT, sub { "$_[0]" };

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       This interface enables some post-processing on output streams, like
       adding a left margin.

       The tied filehandle is opened unbuffered, but the output is line
       buffered. The "tie" takes three optional arguments:

       Left Margin
           The left margin must be a positive integer and defaults to 4
           spaces.

       Output Stream
           The output stream must be an already open stream, with writing
           enabled. The default is *STDOUT. All input methods on the new
           stream are disabled. If a reference to a scalar is passed, it will
           be opened as PerlIO::scalar - in-memory IO, scalar IO. No checks
           performed to see if your perl supports it. If you want it, and your
           perl does not, upgrade.

           Using "binmode ()" on the new stream is allowed and supported.

           OPEN, SEEK, and WRITE are not (yet) implemented.

       Line Modifying Function
           The output is line buffered, to enable line-modifier functions.
           The line (without newline) is passed as the only argument to the
           sub-ref, whose output is printed after the prefix from the first
           argument. A newline is printed after the sub-ref's output.

           To [1mfilter [22ma line, as in [4mremove[24m it from the stream, make the sub
           return [4mundef[24m.

       Tests, tests, tests.  Tests with older perls
